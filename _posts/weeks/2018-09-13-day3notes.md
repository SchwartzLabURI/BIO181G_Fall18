### Describing morality and ethics
- what is for the greater good? perhaps a sacrifice is necessary
- who gets to decide what is ethical
- consequentialists
  - maximize pleasure and minimize pain - utilitarianism
- categorical:
  - the act itself has morality regardless of "positive" tradeoff 
- does consent impact the morality of the decision
- how do we place value on life or things
  - are values different for different individuals or categories
- what are your fundamental rights?
  - how are they protected?

### How should we think about data use and sharing in light of existing moral philosophy?
- sharing location / traffic data is a minimal cost to the individual in exchange for the value of traffic, gaining time 
  - assuming data is safe
- you're consenting when you download the app to share your data
  - we're trusting it's anonymous
  - but the apps aren't always transparent about what you're consenting to
- sharing location data has serious risks, and maybe traffic info isn't that important (or get it from the radio)
- what's the right to privacy in the data that's in your phone?
- moral obligation to provide detailed information on what data is being used and how
