### What data are available to understand crime rates and recidivism?
- individual's education
- individual's history of substance abuse
- crimes commited by friends/family
- individual's neighborhood / socioeconomic status
- individual's history of crime
- individual's experience with police
  - highly dependent on neighborhood / race
  - family related experience
- individual's employment history

- police / FBI reports of crime and victims
- police judge people / neighborhoods based on "observed" crime

### Crime analytics are good and morally acceptable
- seems to reduce / might reduce violent crime
- modeling recidivism factors might help us help people
- models can be more fair by removing human bias
- modeling recidivism may allow people who won't commit crimes to get out
- increased police presence in high crime areas can prevent crime
- data is true so basing decisions on this can be helpful in reducing crime
- so long as models are transparent and continually updated and compared to others

### Crime analytics are not worth the moral cost and price of individual rights
- models are potentially discriminatory 
  - using socioeconomic status (and similar) reflects poorly on innocent people
- overly targetted toward petty crimes without catching major crimes
- increasing police presence in one area removes the police from other areas where they might be needed
  - doesn't really solve the crime problem
- data on where crime is happening may be biased
- if data is totally transparent then what does this do to individuals
