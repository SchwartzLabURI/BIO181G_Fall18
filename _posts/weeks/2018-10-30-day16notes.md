### Book narratives
- follow the sentiments in books over time (much like twitter and other word data)
- from data emerges consistent story arcs
- see slides

### Machine learning in book data (words)
- history of understanding ratio of male:female centered books
- understanding gender bias requires intensive categorization / reading
- use information from 200 books and features about those books to determine important features in predicting whether the book is male or female centered
- selecting important features (from a long list) is the same as selecting important predictors in marketing (ie who will buy) or in recidivism (who will reoffend)
  - see slides
- test model on another set of books and examine success
- predict male or female centered for all remaining books

### Grouping Sherlock Holmes books (see the app)
- without you providing a list of features, ML groups books based on word frequency
- unsupervised ML (compared to supervised ML, where characteristics were compared to known outcomes)

### Where are you from? (see the app)
- pretty accurate
- based on multiple questions each of which provides some probability of assigning you to a location
- questions may differ for different people as particular sets of questions indicate particular locations
- each question has some info, no one answer is diagnostic

### Lyrics (see interactive site)
- some lyrics are timeless (Love)
- repetition is increasing
- number of words is decreasing
- vulgarity is increasing
- word use reflects society
- ML can be used to develop a model to predict genre from lyrics

### How we find music has changed
- what music you listen to is the result of targeting (eg Spotify suggestions) rather than general play
-
