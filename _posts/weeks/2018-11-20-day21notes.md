### Data
- How many fires, where, area, etc.
- Changes in forest cover
- Number of people / places impacted by fires
- Sea levels at different times
- Rainfall data
- Windspeed (especially typhoons)
- Particulate matter / pollution

### Information
- Rate of deforestation
- Changes in sea level and rate of change in different places
- Frequency and severity of hurricanes / weather

### Models
- Predict hurricanes
- Predicting when and where fires & movement
- Machine learning for images of deforestation

### Ethical issues
- Obligation to educate the public about what changes occur and what correlations exist - who?
- "Obligation" to regulate companies if we know that pollution occurs and impacts people
- Who is accountable for taking infomation and prediction and doing something?
