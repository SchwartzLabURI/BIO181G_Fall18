### What data did you need / have / use?
- party affiliation / voter registration
- precinct past voting
- population density
- race

### How were you able to manipulate districts to the advantage of one side?
- particular parties are found in particular places
- hard to make districts continuous while also factoring in other issues

### How do districts look when gerrymandered compared to when representation is fair?
- D's tend to compact and urban and R's tend to be spread out and rural

### What does fair representation mean?
- make sure that each party has equal representation in a district
- make sure that people have their issues represented along with people with similar issues

### How can we provide fair representation? 
- legally we must fairly represent people of different races
- statistics: efficiency gap, breaking up counties, compactness, competitiveness
