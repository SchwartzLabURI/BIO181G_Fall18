### Political polls and probability
- who are you polling - is the media picking certain people or accidently missing some
- misinterpreting what the data are telling you

Flip 10 times - this is one sample - count the number of heads
Repeat 4 times

- who is in the sample and how big is it?
- results more consistent with large sample sizes
