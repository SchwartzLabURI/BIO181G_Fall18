### Ethical frameworks and philosophy
- Kant - what we ought to do - what's moral
  - moral rules
  - use of data violates our autonomy
- utilitarianism: overall happiness (sum total)
  - how do we measure this for big data?
- social contracts: we have "agreed" that to be part of society means we follow certain rules
  - have we agreed to share our data in exchange for services?
- virtue ethics: certain things are virtuous / morally correct
- unalienable rights (eg to your data)
- individual rights

### Neutrality - data
- depends on how it's used
  - issues of confirmation bias - trying to use data to fit what we think
- the data itself is neutral
- depends on how we collect the data - there's more data on some people than others
- depends on the size of the dataset (small data may not be accurate)

### Neutrality - algorithms / programs
- because it's complicated you can't determine its bias
- not transparent
- what's included in the program / algorithm affects the result
- machine learning algorithms can skew based on available information
- important to think about the outcome

### Ethics of the census data
- How is information used?
  - Determine representation in congress
  - Determine funding
- Concerns about the citizenship question - what if data is used for harm
  - but it's important to know who is living where

### Neutrality of census data
- information is only available to those who need it / the census bureau
- because of immigrant concerns people may lie or not fill out the census and that skews the data
