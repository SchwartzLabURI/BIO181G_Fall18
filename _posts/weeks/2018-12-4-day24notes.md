### Transit data
- arrival times of subways
- number of riders at different times
- how often trains/buses are running; time between
- where the bus is
- performance of transit - cancelations, delays
- bus speed
- location of boarding / exit
- missing the people who don't have (convenient) service already
- how demand changes daily / annually / seasonally

### Transit 
- subway efficiency 
- calculated demand based on number of people on the train at various times
- 
### Ethical issues
- by overlooking certain people in collecting data we may be underserving those who need it
- mostly we schedule around business hours - who tends not to work those hours?
