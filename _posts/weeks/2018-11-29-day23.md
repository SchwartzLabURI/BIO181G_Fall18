### Before class:

[Editing DNA](https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_doudna_we_can_now_edit_our_dna_but_let_s_do_it_wisely)

### In class

[Switched at birth](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/lifestyle/she-thought-she-was-irish-until-a-dna-test-opened-a-100-year-old-mystery/?utm_term=.069f7a53123a)  
How well do people understand what they consent to in making their data available (e.g. on 23andme)? 

[Catching a killer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/lifestyle/she-thought-she-was-irish-until-a-dna-test-opened-a-100-year-old-mystery/?utm_term=.069f7a53123a)  
Is it fair to use DNA from a public database or crimial records to impact someone who had no knowledge of the availability of their relative's DNA? Consider privacy and consent. Is it ethical that 23andme does not share data with law enforcement?

[Designer babies](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-27/crispr-fears-designer-baby-outrage-won-t-last-as-ethics-evolve)  
Do you agree that concerns about genetically modified babies are overblown? Why or why not?

[Designer babies 2](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/19/designer-babies-ethical-genetic-selection-intelligence)  
Read and discuss the ethical questions at the end of the article. Note the discussion of correlation and probability.
