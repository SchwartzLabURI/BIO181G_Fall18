### What kind of data have we seen?
- Census
  - All data (except people who don't respond and those could be biased)
  - Survey of individuals about themselves
- American Community Survey
  - Sample of people - how representative is this?
  - Individual data
- Crime
  - Police reports (how representative is this of all crime?)
  - Unsure of how reports indicate crime given uncertainty of convictions
- Recidivism
  - Lots of data (though not all)
  - Lots of factors
  - Factors are both related to individuals and proxy (eg neighborhood)
- Flu
  - CDC data - sample of hospitals and doctors
  - Google data - proxy correlates, but a lot of data!
- Unemployment
  - Government labor data - sample of households
  - potential proxy correlates with Google searches
  - not sure the information provided would accurately answer questions of interest
    - eg young people may or may not work but that's different than adults

### What do you see in the unemployment data?
- unemployment is high in the winter (seasonal patterns)
- state unemployment tends to track national levels (tho numbers are different)
  - with exceptions
- unemployment high in 2008-10 then decreasing

### What does it mean to sample
- a complete sample is too expensive
- large samples are more accurate (unemployment studies 110k people)
- average multiple samples
- sample across multiple populations to get a sense of the entire population
  - unemployment surveys use 800 of 2000 sampling units in the US that are reflective of rural/urban, industrial/farming etc
