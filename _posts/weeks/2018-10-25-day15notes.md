### How is Facebook influencing users and why?
- showing you certain posts based on what Facebook thinks you like
- pushes you further toward where you already are
- changing your mood and influencing your actions
  - affects whether you vote
- trying to get you to spend time (so you see more ads and they make $)

### What data is Facebook using?
- demographic information
- messages you like
- words!

### Is Facebook being moral?
- There's more benefit than cost
  - you get a positive facebook experience and they get data to get money
- Shouldn't be regulating free speech
  - we're not sure how much they are filtering
  - what's their obligation to ensure free speech
- People have a choice
  - not on Facebook so no obligation on their part
-
