### data
- sightings of particular species
- satellite data / radar data of reflectivity 
- photos (for id)
- but you're relying on reports
  - better reporting in highly developed areas
- how accurate is the id when done by amateurs?
- what happens when something rare or desirable is reported?

### patterns
- migration patterns (depends on time of year)
  - comes from radar data
- observations at different times of day / year / season
- areas of high and low biodiversity

### models
- predicted range
  - probability of observation
- build machine learning models based on photos to recognize photos
- predict migrations patterns
