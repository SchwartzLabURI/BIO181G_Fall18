### Does what we "know" affect our decisions?

### What do we (as a society) need to know to make decisions about what happens with data?
- how do we balance harm and good on different sides
- what is the source of the data
- how is data protected (government and companies)
- reliability of the data (how do you know / how is unreliable data handled)
- who can see it
- what data do we have to share to get what we want
- what happens to data that you get rid of (how much control do you have)

### What are the arguments for keeping data private and public?
#### Benefits for public data
- it's your choice to make your information public so you must want it public
- makes it possible to find people and reconnect
- makes it possible to connect for jobs you might not get otherwise
- jobs can look you up and you've made choices to post good things that could benefit you
- you can look people up - prepare / feel safe / make hiring decisions
- you've consented (sort of)
- provides safety information
- more good than harm 
- target particular groups 

#### Benefits for private data
- more harm than good from available data
  - not necessary to find someone's address publically
- can prejudge people in a negative way
- past history may not be useful information and may be harmful
- hard to read enough to know what you're consenting to
- prevent targeting particular groups 
- maybe some data could be public but how do we set limits to keep people safe
