### Medical data
- text message words
- speech patterns - sound waves
- medical scan - images

### Text data and health
#### Patterns
- "mom" appear frequently
  - not sure why this appears - unexpected but not sure about context
- the NE has a lot of issues - not sure about mechanism
  - also upper midwest - hypothesize sparse population as mechanism
- more issues late at night and winter
- can you extract population patterns from texts to correlate issues

#### How is data linked to outcomes so the computer can "diagnose"
- certain words are seen as associated with certain issues (particularly)
- set of "training" data

#### Collecting and sharing these datasets
- beneficial because it provides information about indications of personal issues so they can be helped
- not harmful because there's no connection between person and information
- important data patterns to share with support professionals
