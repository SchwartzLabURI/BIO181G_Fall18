### Correlations? Proxy? Harm?
- what you buy predicts what you might buy (and therefore what coupons should be given)
  - maybe harmful to expose personal information
- google flu - searches related to occurence
  - proxy; therefore could be wrong; impact depends on how it's is used
- Amazon book recommendations related to previous purchases
  - proxy; ok
- words in hiring process correlated with expectation of work ethic 
  - proxy; potential for harm due to poor correlations?
- personality test correlated with work
  - information, but maybe not a good correlation
- predicting illness based on your credit report / lifestyle / income
  - correlation is likely true
  - insurance company uses this to change your rate
  - ethical concerns about using this data to infer illness

### What influences purchasing?
- gender (males spend more)
- number of children (more children = less spent)
- age (younger spent less)
- factors might interact
