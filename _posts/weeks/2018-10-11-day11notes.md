- employers who miss out on employees who could be good
- people who aren't prepared for this format / aren't as extroverted

#### What are the ethical issues?
- lack of transparency - what are your rights? what's the harm to the person?
- unsure about fairness of algorithm - is there harm?
- is social media a fair representation of who you are?
- current approaches are often based on fit
  - sometimes fit results in better communication
  - sometimes fit results in picking people like you
  - sometimes fit means people you like but who don't do good work
  - maybe AI doesn't do fit and takes out bias

#### Where's the data
- models built on existing employees
  - who are these employees and are they the best?
  - can test the value of the model by hiring / interviewing and seeing results
